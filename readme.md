# Third Life
Trying to create a stable simulation of worlds based on real research.

Bit by bit we are adding many different aspects of reality with the goal of creating a stable environment where humans can live and prosper. Anthing we add is supported by some kind of research which can be found in the [Gitlab Wiki](https://gitlab.com/groups/kdg-ti/the-lab/teams-23-24/third-life/-/wikis/Project-Overview).
